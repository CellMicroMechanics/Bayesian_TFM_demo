After downloading, launch the demo from the Matlab command line by entering "test_example". Depending on your machine, the calculations can take a few seconds to complete.

The code requires the free Matlab package "Regularization tools" by P.C.
Hansen Math. Model. Comput.(1998) that can be found at
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52-regtools.
To use this tool, download the package and add it to the Matlab path
,e.g, by entering the command "path(path,'Hansen')".
